BG_nophaser: Ambient background audio recorded in the Union. I cut out some of the high frequencies so that it didn't compete with the percussion and looped it a few times by fading it into itself so that the loop wasn't as apparent.
BG_phaser: The above sound but with a phaser effect.

Demo_Sequence: A non-interactive version of the percussion composition.
iterative: An unused track, based on the use of canons in compositon. One melodic phrase for each intended looping section.

All samples were used to create a short percussion composition -- upon picking up one of the cubes scattered about the landscape, a loop composed of a single repeated sample is added onto the current background audio.
Not included in the game was a composition based on creating a melody with one of the pitched sounds and playing that same melody over itself, iteratively offsetting the second melody by x amount of beats.
